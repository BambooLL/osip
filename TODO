TODO file for oSIP.

  *  Make the Documentation more up to date...
        * current is about 0.7.X.
  *  Transport layer that can reconnect to another port at run time.
	*  add a list_t of descriptor for UDP and another for TCP
		in the osip_t structure.
  *  Support for multiple header on the same line (partially done)
	* Some nasty behavior can still exist for unknown header
	that accept ',' in their definition.
  *  Support for FreeBSD (semget, semop...)
  *  fsm for proxy.
