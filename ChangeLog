          to manage transaction with non-sipurl in the To or From header!
	* urls.h: fix MACROs for adding parameters.
	* new optional algo using gpref (thanks to <chenshx@mail.datang.com>)

	* New checking rules compliant to the latest draft for internal
	  management of transactions.
	* "make check" is available and improve results ouput.

libosip (0.8.5)
	* Dialog fully tested and hoped to be correct.

	* contact_param_add: fix MACRO! an argument was missing.
	* dialog.c: make it more compliant: TO BE TESTED!
	* transaction.c: MAJOR CHANGE: transaction_free() must now be called by the
	  application! This way, you can re-use data before releasing the context..
	* add a failure case when there is no '>' char when '<' is found.
	* fix compilations issue with --disable-mt.
	
libosip (0.8.4)
	* ist_fsm.c: start timer i while entering CONFIRMED state.
	* urls.c: bug in line 210.
	* msg_cparser.c: switch CONTACT_SHORT & CONTENT_LENGTH_SHORT in table.

	  this method was previously used ONLY for incoming message.

	  and osip_create_transaction() instead.

	* smsg.h: fix MACROS
	
libosip (0.8.3)

libosip (0.8.1) testing ;urgency=high
	* new finite state machines for TRANSACTION LAYER compliant with
	  the rfc2543bis-09.txt. This is a total rewrite. Those new
	  fsm should be usable either by proxies and endpoints. The
	  difference is in the UAC_UAC_core and Proxy_core. (Stateless
	  proxy don't need any state machines!)
	* some bug fixes and one memory leak in the parser.
