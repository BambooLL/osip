libosip (0.8.1) testing ;urgency=high
	* new finite state machines for TRANSACTION LAYER compliant with
	  the rfc2543bis-09.txt. This is a total rewrite. Those new
	  fsm should be usable either by proxies and endpoints. The
	  difference is in the UAC_UAC_core and Proxy_core. (Stateless
	  proxy don't need any state machines!)
	* some bug fixes and one memory leak in the parser.
	* COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE IS NOT KEPT!
	* test in ./example and ./example_mt are deprecated and removed.
