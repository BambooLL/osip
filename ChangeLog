libosip (0.8.4)
	* urls.c: bug in line 210.
	* msg_cparser.c: switch CONTACT_SHORT & CONTENT_LENGTH_SHORT in table.
	* osip.c: add osip_find_transaction() and osip_create_transaction()
	  This is needed so SIP messages like retransmission of 200 OK for
	  INVITE are not discarded by osip_distribute_event()

libosip (0.8.3)
	* add lock/unlock methods for searching in transactions
	* improve reliability when a NULL pointer is given to *_free methods.
	* many bugs fixes in fsm/*
	* parser/hdr_via.c: support for ipv6. Previous version are not compliant.
	
libosip (0.8.2)
	* ipv6 support (need more testing.)  - Thanks to tomohide.
	* support for any scheme in url. (Use with care with applications.)
	* support for sysv semaphore.
	
libosip (0.8.1) testing ;urgency=high
	* new finite state machines for TRANSACTION LAYER compliant with
	  the rfc2543bis-09.txt. This is a total rewrite. Those new
	  fsm should be usable either by proxies and endpoints. The
	  difference is in the UAC_UAC_core and Proxy_core. (Stateless
	  proxy don't need any state machines!)
	* some bug fixes and one memory leak in the parser.
	* COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE IS NOT KEPT!
	* test in ./example and ./example_mt are deprecated and removed.

        * Windows updates makefiles (VC6++, tested on NT4).
        * gcc-3.0 updates and ANSI modifications:
        * Thanks to marko for little improvments.

libosip (0.7.8) testing ;urgency=high
