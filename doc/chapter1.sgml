<title>The SIP protocol</title>

<para>SIP is a signaling protocol used to initiate and control multimedia sessions. It is already published by IETF (www.ietf.org) as the rfc2543.</para>
<para>SIP is part of the IETF effort to bring telephony on the IP network.  It is about to become the standard used by the emerging IP telephony industry. As simple as the mail protocol, it may become as popular...

<primary>SIP is independent of media</primary>
</indexterm>
<para>The traditional telephony was based on one media. Now, it's over. Your phone will be able to connect to a TV, to a camera, to others phones with different qualities and different codecs. Hopefully, SIP is independent of any media used by the applications. SIP is able to negotiate media used within sessions. Any multimedia application (games, distance learning application) can use SIP to set up sessions.

<title>SIP is independent of the transport layer</title>
<para>SIP is not tight to any transport protocol. This aspect will minimize efforts to interoperate with new third generation networks. Wireless phones are also concerned. A SIP stack perfectly fits the signaling needs of the new cellulars' generation.

<title>SIP is extensible</title>
<para>The rfc2543 defines 6 types of transaction (INVITE, BYE, CANCEL...). Those transactions are used to negotiate media, set up, modify and terminate calls. Many services are already provided this way but SIP is designed for extensibility and the transactional model can be reused (transparently for servers) by new type of transaction to create some supplementary services. Here is a list of possible services:

<simplelist>
<member>MESSAGE for instant messaging</member>
<member>SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for presence management</member>
<member>REFER for call-transfer management</member>
</simplelist>

<title>SIP and end-user services</title>
<para><quote>SIP transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, allowing the implementation of ISDN and Intelligent Network telephony subscriber services. These facilities also enable personal mobility.

<para>SIP servers are used to locate users and distribute location (through urls) on demand. This way, end user agents have very minimal requirements and still have access to a wide variety of services.
</para>
<para>Many extensions are already available as draft. Your can also add your personal phone capabilities and remain interoperable with existing servers.
